              <h2>Space Isn’t As Colorful As NASA’s Photos Make It Seem</h2>
              <h4>Sep 26, 2016</h4>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever you see pictures of space, the first thing that comes to most people’s minds is probably WOW!<wbr>
                Look at those beautiful colors. But then there people who start exclaiming “This isn’t how space looks like!<wbr> 
                ” And “These images are fake”.<wbr>
                We know they are, but you shouldn’t be complaining about simple stuff like this,<wbr>
                because I for one would not be really interested in looking at those photos if they had really dull colors.<wbr>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An astrophysicist, Paul Sutter, talked at Space.com about this issue and asked people to tone down the complaints. <wbr>
                Sutter is from the Ohio State University and is working as the chief scientist at the COSI Science Center.<wbr>
                 He explained how important it is for NASA to boost the image quality, the reason is not to attract more likes or shares but<wbr> 
                 because of science. Even a little touch up could help them understand many complex stuff that otherwise wouldn’t be possible.

            <h2>Government Space is Business Space</h2>
            <h4> July 16, 2019</h4>
            <img src="pic2.png" width="550" height="400">
            <p> 
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What’s the proper dividing line between what government does and what business does?
               This is not a political question — it is meant in the context of the space industry.
               There used to be a pretty bright dividing line. There was NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and other 
               space agencies in civilian space, and the military and security services operating in military space. 
               The demands of security and resilience against attack still keep military space a separate and largely secret kingdom. 
               But even there, the military doesn’t build things; it contracts with private-sector companies to design and build them. 
               It engages companies and outside contractors to operate a lot of them. And, of course, it uses commercial satellite
               capacity to handle the majority of its communications traffic.
